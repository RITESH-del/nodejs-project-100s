You need to build a CLI (Command Line Interface) application in Node.js that:

Takes two arguments from the command line:

a URL (e.g. https://example.com)

a CSS selector (e.g. "h1")

Fetches the HTML content of the page at that URL. Using Axios.

Uses cheerio (a jQuery-like library for Node) to parse the HTML.

Prints the text content of the element(s) that match the selector.
